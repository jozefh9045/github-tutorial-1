## Git vs. GitHub
Although Git and GitHub sound similar, they are very different.  
Git is your regular work space. It is the location where you type your   
code and it can be both on or off line. It can be considered the local file.
    
###Examples of Git would be:

* _cloud9_
* _Nitrious_

Github is a website on the cloud. You can put code into it and take it out   
and others can access it easily.

To use Git and Github, you would have to type your code in git then commit  
your work and push it into the github. You can also pull or make copies of   
it (cloning) if you need to later on. It is called the remote.

## Initial Setup
Before you pull or push code into and out of Github, Github must know where the  
code and coming from. So you must connect your coding platform with Github in  
the cloud.

###Steps for Initial setup:
1. make a Github account
2. find the SSH key of the Git and us to connect to the github
3. copy and paste the SSH key into the github (it can start with ssh-rsa)
4. Then you will need to connect your username and yoru email to github though  
git.
5. So you use _git config_ for your remote (cloud) to understand it.


---
## Repository Setup
Setting up a Repository will let you push things into github. A Repository is  
a local file where you can type your code.

You can work on a file and connect it to Github.  

In order to connect it to the github you must initialize, **save**, add, commit and 
push:  

initialize:

    Git init <inside of repository>
    
save:  

    command/control S 

add:

    git add <name of file>
    
commit:

    git commit -m <"any name that work for coder">
    
Status (if you need):

    Git status (tells you the situation)
    
Push:

    Git push 

Then if you check the Github page that you comected the repository to, you will  
see the changes that you have made.

git: a basic command that recognizes git  
remote: this is the connection to the file that can be altered in github  
add: a remote repo will be added

## Workflow & Commands

When typing work, it can get messy. SO you need to format the page to make it  
more readable:

Italics:

    _text_
    
bold:

    **text**
    
largest header:

    # text

smaller headers:

    ##text
    ###text
    ####text
    
add picture or link:

    [text](URL)
    
bullets:

    * text
    * text

ordered list:

    1. text
    2. text
    3. text
    
line break:

    text(then two spaces)
