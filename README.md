## Git vs. GitHub
Although Git and GitHub sound similar, they are very different.  
Git is your regular work space. It is the location where you type your   
code and it can be both on or off line.
    
###Examples of Git would be:

* _cloud9_
* _Nitrious_

Github is a website on the cloud. You can put code into it and take it out   
and others can access it easily.

To use Git and Github, you would have to type your code in git then commit  
your work and push it into the github. You can also pull or make copies of   
it (cloning) if you need to later on.

## Initial Setup
Before you pull or push code into and out of Github, Github must know where the  
code and coming from. So you must connect your coding platform with Github in  
the cloud.

###Steps for Initial setup:
1. make a Github account
2. find the SSH key of the Git and us to connect to the github
3. copy and paste the SSH key into the github (it can start with ssh-rsa)
4. Then you will need to connect your username and yoru email to github though  
git.
